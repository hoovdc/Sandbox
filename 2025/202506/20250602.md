# Scoring System Phase 3 - Implementation Status & Planning

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Phase 3 Status**: **75% Complete** - Core architecture in place, but **significant scoring logic, constant tuning, and validation are still required.**

**üö® IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**: Scoring anomalies detected:
- Competition scores: Now varying, but penalty logic and constants require further review to ensure appropriate impact.
- Demographics scores: Now varying and appearing more reasonable; sub-component logic and scaling under review for clarity.
- Cotenant scores: Varying, but still not accurate and reasonable.

**Scoring Anomalies**: üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES PARTIALLY ADDRESSED, INVESTIGATION ONGOING**. Recent GSheet output shows scores are still not varying appropriately and contain internal contradictions. While the 5-tier assessment category structure is in place, the underlying numerical scores and assessments are incorrect. Direct component testing via `debug_scoring_investigation.py` shows some improvements as noted above.

**For comprehensive system information, see:**
- **Current System Documentation**: [`scoring_README.md`](scoring_README.md)
- **Visual Architecture**: [`architecture_diagrams.md`](architecture_diagrams.md)
- **Migration History**: [`scoring_phase3_done.md`](scoring_phase3_done.md)

### Key Accomplishments ‚úÖ
- **Type Safety**: All scoring components have comprehensive type hints.
- **Data Normalization**: Type-safe normalizers handle format chaos.
- **Standardized Scoring**: Unified 0-100 scale throughout.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns implemented.
- **Project Structure**: Clean organization with proper file placement.

**System Status**: Architecture largely complete, but **scoring logic and constant values require immediate and significant fixes and refinement.** Standardization of assessment category *structure* is done, but its application and accuracy are flawed.

### Remaining Work & Priorities (Estimated 3-4 days - pending investigation)

This section outlines the prioritized tasks to complete Phase 3.

**Investigation Tool**: `Tests/scoring/debug_scoring_investigation.py` (Script has been refactored to use `ScoringService` and is now a more reliable tool for direct component-level testing. GSheet generation and its observed discrepancies are a separate, subsequent concern that needs investigation of the GSheet generation process itself).

#### 1. üö® CRITICAL (RE-OPENED): Fix Scoring Anomalies & Address GSheet Discrepancies (Estimated 2.0-2.5 days - Collaborative Approach)

**Goal**: Correct scoring logic for ALL components (Competition, Demographics, Cotenant, Visibility, Overall) to ensure scores vary appropriately, accurately reflect business logic, and resolve contradictions seen in GSheet outputs.

**Root Cause Analysis Summary (based on recent GSheet output and previous code state):**
-   **GSheet Output Contradictions**:
    -   *Issue*: "SCORING DETAILS BREAKDOWN" and "SUMMARY" sheets show different assessments and final scores for the same components (e.g., Co-Tenant 0 vs 100; Demographics sub-assessments; Visibility Road Type assessment; Overall Score 65 vs 87).
    -   *Hypothesis*: Potential bugs in the GSheet generation/export logic, or different underlying logic/data sources being hit for different report sections. The refactored `debug_scoring_investigation.py` is for direct component testing and is distinct from this GSheet generation process. **Investigating the GSheet generation path is crucial to establish a reliable debugging baseline for sheet outputs.**
-   **Competition Scoring (Review Ongoing):**
    -   *Issue*: Scores are now varying (e.g., 100, 68, 52 observed in tests), which is an improvement from always being high. However, the penalty logic (magnitudes, scaling factor, min score, base penalties in `competition.json`) still requires significant refinement to ensure appropriate impact from competitor presence.
    -   *Hypothesis*: Constants in `competition.json` need further tuning.
-   **Demographics Scoring (Improved, Review Ongoing):**
    -   *Issue*: Scores are now varying more appropriately (e.g., 26, 80, 88 observed in tests) and not consistently low. The main focus is now on ensuring clarity and correctness of sub-component assessment logic, their scaling (e.g., 0-5 base scores if used), and aggregation to the final 0-100 component score.
    -   *Hypothesis*: Review `demographics.json` and related `assessment_to_score` calls or custom scaling logic for transparency and correctness.
-   **Cotenant Scoring (Over-scoring Concern, Review Ongoing):**
    -   *Issue*: Direct component tests show scores vary (e.g., 0, 84, 100), but 100/100 for scenarios with multiple stores is a concern for potential over-scoring. The GSheet discrepancy ("SCORING DETAILS" shows 0/100 total despite "Excellent" sub-component assessments vs. "SUMMARY" sheet shows 100/100) is a separate GSheet generation issue.
    -   *Hypothesis*: Cotenant scoring logic and/or constants in `cotenant.json` may need adjustment to handle multiple stores more granularly. `assessment_to_score` usage for sub-components needs verification.
   **Visibility Scoring (Significantly Improved, Minor Review Remaining):**
    -   *Issue*: Scores are now behaving more reasonably (e.g., "Good" at 88, "Poor" at 45, "Excellent" at 91 in tests) after adjustments to `visibility.json` constants (volume and speed thresholds). The GSheet contradictory assessment for Road Type is a separate GSheet generation issue.
    -   *Hypothesis*: The primary constant-driven issues have been addressed. The Python logic for speed assessment in `scoring/visibility.py` (higher speed = better score) is noted as counter-intuitive and can be reviewed as a future refinement if necessary. No immediate action on Python code unless further issues found.
   **Overall Score Calculation:**
    -   *Issue*: Discrepancy between 65/100 and 87/100 in GSheet.
    -   *Hypothesis*: Different calculation methods or input component scores being used in different reporting paths.

**Step-by-Step Fixes & Refinements:**
   **a. GSheet Discrepancy Investigation (Highest Priority):**
       - Analyze the GSheet generation/export logic (distinct from `debug_scoring_investigation.py`) to understand how "SCORING DETAILS BREAKDOWN" and "SUMMARY" data is sourced, calculated, and displayed.
       - Identify and fix the root cause of contradictions to ensure a single source of truth for GSheet outputs.
   **b. Competition Scoring:** (‚ö†Ô∏è Review Ongoing)
       - Continue review and adjustment of penalty magnitudes, scaling factors, and base penalties in `competition.json`.
       - Ensure penalties are appropriately impactful for high competitor counts.
       - **Validation**: Use `debug_scoring_investigation.py` for component-level testing. GSheet "Details" (once reliable) can provide an additional view.
   **c. Demographics Scoring:** (üîç Review Ongoing)
       - Review and clarify assessment logic for sub-components (Population, Income, etc.) and their scaling to the 0-100 component score (verifying use of `assessment_to_score` vs. direct 0-5 scale logic).
       - Ensure 0-5 base scores (if applicable) are correctly derived and then scaled to 0-100 for each sub-component.
       - Verify weighting and summation to achieve the final 0-100 component score.
       - **Validation**: Use `debug_scoring_investigation.py`. GSheet "Details" (once reliable) for an additional view.
   **d. Cotenant Scoring:** (‚ö†Ô∏è Review Ongoing for Over-scoring)
       - Investigate and address potential over-scoring, especially with multiple co-tenants.
       - Confirm how 0-5 "Base Scores" for sub-components (Proximity, Count) are generated and then converted/combined into the final 0-100 score.
       - If `assessment_to_score` is used, ensure it correctly processes assessments with appropriate `component_scale` or `score_categories` from `cotenant.json`.
       - **Validation**: Use `debug_scoring_investigation.py`. The GSheet 0/100 vs 100/100 error needs to be addressed via GSheet generation logic investigation.
   **e. Visibility Scoring:** (‚úÖ Significantly Improved, Minor Review Pending)
       - Primary constants in `visibility.json` have been adjusted, leading to more reasonable scores.
       - The Python logic for speed assessment in `scoring/visibility.py` (higher speed = better score) is noted as counter-intuitive and can be reviewed as a future refinement if necessary. No immediate action on Python code unless further issues found.
       - **Validation**: Use `debug_scoring_investigation.py`. GSheet "Details" road type discrepancy needs to be addressed via GSheet generation logic.
   **f. Overall Score Calculation:** (‚ö†Ô∏è GSheet Discrepancy)
       - Determine why "Details" (65/100) and "Summary" (87/100) differ.
       - Ensure `scoring/service.py` (or equivalent) calculates the overall score consistently using the correct component weights and verified component scores.
       - **Validation**: Check relevant overall score calculation logic.

**Success Criteria for Anomaly Fixes:**
‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY MET. Scores must:
    - Vary appropriately and reasonably based on input data and business logic. (Improved for Competition, Demographics, Visibility; Cotenant needs review for over-scoring).
    - Be consistent across different reporting views (GSheet Details vs. Summary). (‚ùå Still a major issue for GSheet outputs).
    - Correctly implement the 0-100 scale for all components and sub-components where applicable. (Generally in place structurally; logical application under review).
    - Utilize constants and weighting logically.
    - Raise errors for genuinely bad/missing data as per "fail fast" principle.

#### 2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Review Text-to-Number Conversion & Assessment Logic (Estimated 0.5 days)
**Goal**: Ensure clarity and correctness in how text assessments (e.g., "Excellent", "Very Poor") are derived for sub-components, how these map to initial numerical scores (e.g., the 0-5 "Base Scores" in GSheet), and how these are then processed by `assessment_to_score` (if at all) or scaled to the 0-100 range before weighting.
**Timing**: After critical scoring anomalies are actively being fixed.
**Benefit**: Ensure precision, correct application of `assessment_to_score` vs. other scaling, and maintainability. The current GSheet implies a 0-5 scale is prevalent for initial assessments, which needs to be harmonized with the 0-100 scale of `assessment_to_score`.

#### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Complete Documentation (Estimated 0.5 days)
**Timing**: After major scoring logic is verified and stable.
**Tasks**:
1.  **Normalizer Usage Guide** (`Docs/scoring/normalizer_guide.md`):
    -   Usage examples for each normalizer.
    -   Troubleshooting guide for data format issues.
    -   Integration patterns.
2.  **API Documentation Updates**:
    -   Function docstrings with comprehensive type information.
    -   Input/output format examples.
    -   Error handling documentation.
    -   Reflect changes made to logic and data flow.

#### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Legacy Code Cleanup (Estimated 0.5 days)
**Timing**: After documentation.
**Cleanup Scope**:
-   Remove dead code: Unused functions and obsolete logic.
-   Consolidate duplicated functions: Merge similar functionality.
-   Clean up import statements: Remove unused imports.
-   Standardize code style: Ensure consistency across modules.
-   Remove debug/temporary code, including all temporary logging added during anomaly fixing.
**Success Criteria**:
-   Reduced code complexity and maintenance burden.
-   Improved code readability and consistency.
-   No functional regressions.
-   Cleaner module structure.

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. üö® INVESTIGATE GSHEET CONTRADICTIONS (IMMEDIATE):
    a. Analyze the GSheet export/generation logic to find why "Details" and "Summary" differ.
    b. Establish a reliable GSheet output for debugging individual component scores.
2. üîß REFINE SCORING LOGIC & CONSTANTS (CRITICAL - Parallel Work Possible after GSheet baseline established):
    a. **Co-Tenant**: Focus on preventing over-scoring. Review base score logic vs. `assessment_to_score`.
    b. **Demographics**: Continue review of sub-component assessment logic and scaling for clarity and correctness.
    c. **Competition**: Continue refining penalty constants for appropriate impact.
    d. **Visibility**: Monitor. Constants improved significantly. Python speed logic in `scoring/visibility.py` is a potential future refinement.
    e. **Overall Score**: Ensure consistent calculation once GSheet issues resolved and component scores verified.
3. üß™ VALIDATE FIXES CONTINUOUSLY: Use `debug_scoring_investigation.py` for component-level validation. Once GSheet generation is reliable, use its "Details" view to confirm component logic.
4. üìù DOCUMENT CHANGES: As fixes are made and validated, update relevant sections of `scoring_README.md` and other documentation. Complete the Normalizer Guide and API docs once logic is stable.
5. üßê REVIEW TEXT-TO-NUMBER CONVERSION: Once component scores are sensible, review the sub-component assessment to numerical score pipeline (0-5 "Base Scores" vs. `assessment_to_score` outputs).
6. üßπ CLEANUP: Perform legacy code cleanup, remove temporary logging.
7. üèÅ FINAL SYSTEM VALIDATION: Full run of debug script, review all scores.
